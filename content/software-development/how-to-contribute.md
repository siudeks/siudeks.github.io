## Bug reporting

[Source: linuxconf 2015](https://fr.slideshare.net/jpetazzo/how-to-contribute-to-large-open-source-projects-like-docker-linuxcon-2015)

What makes a bad bug report??

- Emailing the user mailing list
- Emailing the maintainers directly
- Emailing the wrong people (e.g. of a different project)
- "It doesn't work"
- Rage tweet
- No follow-up (when you find the root cause / solution, or realize it was all your fault)

What makes a good bug report?

- Use the bug tracker where there is one
- Look for duplicates
- Look for instructions about filling bugs (should you use tags? run special commands?)
- Three parts:
  - when I do ____
  - I'm expecting ____ to happen
  - But instead, I'm seeing _

Include relevant versions and logs

Note: yes, 'relevant' is subjective and therefore hard
