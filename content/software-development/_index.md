### My recommendations in 2019

- How to group DDD topics [Awesome DDD](https://github.com/heynickc/awesome-ddd)
- How to organize announcements based on GitHub - based on [dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements)
- Hewitt, Meijer and Szyperski: [The Actor Model (everything you wanted to know...)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7erJ1DV_Tlo)

### My recommendations in 2018

- [Data Consistency in Microservice Using Sagas](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/saga-microservices/) by Chris Richardson (creator of [Eventuate](https://eventuate.io/)) published 2018/I
topics saga pattern, microservices, data consistency  
Well, he shares practical advices how to use sagas with compensation instead to use ACID transactions. It is quite close to my experience, so I would like to recommed it.
- [From Zero to Hero with Spring WebSocket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxakp15CACY&feature=youtu.be) by Sergi Almar, recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015
topics java, Spring, WebSockets, SockJS, STOMP
Very practical example how to use (and understand) STOMP over SockJS to two way communication between JS and Java. Have you wondered how to practically use WebSockets? It is for you.

### My recommendations in 2017

- [an Introduction to CQRS & Axon](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/cqrs-axon/?utm_source=presentations_about_axon-framework&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=axon-framework) by Allard Buijze on Aug 31, 2014  
topics: java, CQRS  
Ineresting introduction why Allard have created Axon framework. I especially like his example with explosing of domain models and spaghetti SQL.
- [Event Sourcing on the JVM](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/event-sourcing-jvm/) by Greg Young.  
topics: java, event sourcing  
Quite good presentation (52 mins), first half contains live-based examples why event sourcing is a natural way of storing changes, and why sql database is not. The second half of the presentation is about jvm implementatsion worth to be considered as event sourcing in your's java application.
- [BDD & DDD](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/bdd-and-ddd/)  
topics: BDD, DDD (what a surprise)  
Solid explanation what is DDD and BDD, without a technical implementations but with examples. Good to share among devs, QAs and BAs.

### Interesting topics  

#### Monads

## Interesting comments found on the internet

- Remove the ............................. because of limited usage and effort required to maintain it is significant.
- First of all, as already said many times, courtesy is appreciated here. Things like Hi, Thx...
- I want to keep my technology zoo at a minimum.
- Closing the issue as there is no reproduction case provided. Feel free to ask for reopening if it is still actual.
- Please don't comment on closed issue. It's difficult enough to follow development here, but if you use the issue-tracker as kind of "chat-support-system" then things become very difficult.
- Thanks for reaching out and providing feedback. We are working hard on improving the app experience. Can you please elaborate further about the issue?
- You forgot to ask a question (in a problem description on Stack Overflow)
- This is extremely painful. Any issues with (...) can break an entire projects and require extensive manual intervention with advanced, potentially dangerous procedures to remedy.
